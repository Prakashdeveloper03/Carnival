Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest - DeepSeek. Concepts that once felt intimidating now feel second nature.  An added bonus was the notes, which removed the overhead of excessive note-taking and allowed for more focused learning. The balance between theory and hands-on learning was perfect, making it easy to apply new knowledge in real-world projects. By the end of the course, I feel a significant boost in my confidence—whether at work, workshops, meetups, discussions, projects, or analyzing cutting-edge AI advancements.
